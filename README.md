# Algorithms
Algorithms I implemented for Courses, Codeforces.com, or Competitions. Generally no comments in the code because all of these algorithms were implemented under time pressure. At the time when I was taking the D&A and A&W courses I didn't pay much attention to keeping everything clean and orderly. I very much regret that since now I can not find all of the assignment questions leaving me with code that has no context. 

Hope these algorithm problems will help someone prepare for exams at some point.

Cheers
